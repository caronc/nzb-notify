Send notifications to all of the popular notification services (PushBullet, NotifyMyAndroid, XBMC, Email etc) from NZBGet or SABnzbd. 
You can chain as many notification services as you want and support most of the advance features each service offers you too.
You can even run the tool from the command line for your own custom use. 

## Built on Apprise

This guts of this script have been recently extracted into it's own project called [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) which allows others to build Notifications into their applications as well.
Apprise was written in such a way that there wouldn't be a lot of effort to add more notification services either. Feel free to contact me if one you would like to use is missing.

## Supported Notifications

For a complete list of supported notification services and examples on how to build their URLs [click here](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki#notification-services). 

## Installation and usage instructions

1. Ensure you have Python v2.7 or later installed onto your system.
```bash
# Pull in dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Simply place the `Notify.py` and `Notify` directory together.
   * __NZBGet users__: you'll want to place these inside of your _nzbget/scripts_ directory. Please ensure you are running _(at least)_ NZBGet v11.0 or higher. You can acquire the latest version of of it from [here](https://nzbget.net/download).
   * __NZBGet users__: As one additional note; this script makes use of the RPC feature of NZBGet in order to retrive all of the status information it will notify you with.  Its very important that this is configured correctly (in the 'Settings -> Security' area). The out of the box settings should work fine; but worth noting here should experience any issues.
   * __SABnzbd users__: You'll point your SABnzbd configuration to reference `sabnzbd-notify.py` via the _Script_ entry and _not_ `Notify.py`. However, please note that the `Notify.py` script is still required (as `sabnzbd-notify.py` is a wrapper to it).  You will use the _Parameters_ section to provide the services you wish to notify (see below how they are constructed).

See the __Command Line__ section below for more instructions on how to call the script from the command line.

## SABnzbd Users
SABnzbd users can test that their script is working okay manually as well if they're having issues with it through their application.  This is also a great way to test out that you've created the correct URL string.
```bash
# Send a notification to XBMC (assuming its listening on
# port 8080 at the ip 192.168.0.2 with respect to the example
# below:
python sabnzbd-notify.py complete 'Hello' 'World' xbmc://192.168.0.2
```
The syntax is very similar except SABnzbd expects 4 distinct arguments.

| Arg # | Description |
| ----- |:----------- |
|   1   | The type of notification we are sending.  This has an impact on the icon (for those that support it) that you will pass along with the message.
|   2   | The title of the notification message.  If this is an empty string, then there is enough information based on the notification type you passed in (argument 1) to generate a title. |
|   3   | The message body. |
|   4   | Comma delimited URL strings just like the ones already discussed above.

### SABnzbd Configuration
First, make sure you've placed `sabnzb-notify.py`, `Notify.py`, and the `Notify` directory inside of the `/path/to/SABnzbd/scripts/` directory or the instructions below will not work.

Once you know the _URL_(s) that work for you, you can set SABnzbd to automatically notify setting it up as follows. From within SABnzbd's web interface:

- Click on __Settings__
- Click on __Notifications__
- Place a checkbox in the __Enable notification script__ option.
- Choose `sabnzb-notify.py` from the Script dropdown menu.
- Specify the URL such as `kodi://192.168.0.2` in the _Parameters_ section. You can specify more then one URL here by simply using a _comma_ (`,`) as a delimiter.

CentOS/RedHat users can also refer to a [blog entry I prepared](https://nuxref.com/2016/10/20/sabnzbd-installation-centos-7/) for this which includes RPM packaging for both [SABnzbd](https://repo.nuxref.com/centos/7/en/x86_64/custom/repoview/sabnzbd.html) and [NZB-Notify](https://repo.nuxref.com/centos/7/en/x86_64/custom/repoview/sabnzbd-script-notify.html). These can be easily installed (with all required dependencies by just getting yourself set up with my repository [here](https://nuxref.com/nuxref-repository/).

## Command Line

`Notify.py` has a built in command line interface that can be easily tied
to a cron entry or can be easily called from the command line to automate
the fetching of subtitles.

Here are the switches available to you:
```
Usage: Notify.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s URL(s), --servers=URL(s)
                        Specify 1 or more servers in their URL format ie:
                        growl://mypass@localhost
  -t TITLE, --title=TITLE
                        Specify the title of the notification message.
  -b BODY, --body=BODY  Specify the body of the notification message.
  -i, --include_image   Include image in message if the protocol supports it.
  -u IMAGE_URL, --image_url=IMAGE_URL
                        Provide url to image; should be either http://,
                        https://, or file://. This option implies that
                        --include_image (-i) is set automatically
  -L FILE, --logfile=FILE
                        Send output to the specified logfile instead of
                        stdout.
  -D, --debug           Debug Mode
```

Here is simple example:
```bash
# Send a notification to XBMC (assuming its listening on
# port 8080 at the ip 192.168.0.2 with respect to the example
# below:
python Notify.py -s xbmc://192.168.0.2 -t "Hello" -b "World!"

# you can also use it's new name (kodi) to achive the same
# results:
python Notify.py -s kodi://192.168.0.2 -t "Hello" -b "World!"
```

You can also mix and match as many servers as you want by separating
your urls with a comma and/or space.
```bash
# Send a notification to XBMC and a Growl Server
python Notify.py \
    -s growl://192.168.0.10,xbmc://user:pass@192.168.0.2 \
    -t "Hello" -b "World!"
```
